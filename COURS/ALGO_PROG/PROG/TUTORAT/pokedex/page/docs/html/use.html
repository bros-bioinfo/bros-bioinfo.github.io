<span id="use"></span><h1>Using PAGE<a class="headerlink" href="#using-page" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>PAGE is built upon the program Visual Tcl, but is different because of
differing objectives of the two programs.  Visual Tcl was conceived as
complete build environment for Tcl. It included facilities for
managing projects with multiple windows, creating of GUI&#8217;s, binding
actions with callback procedures, creating menus, writing functions,
and testing the application, all the while supporting many different
widget sets and several geometry managers. PAGE is limited to defining
a single GUI window using Tk and ttk widgets and the placer geometry
manager; there are better environments for building and debugging
Python programs once you have code for the GUI.</p>
<p>PAGE makes use of the Virtual Tcl facilities for creating a single GUI
window, assigning attributes to widgets, binding events to callback
procedures, and creating menus. PAGE also automatically generates
skeletal callback functions and supplies much of the boilerplate code
for running Tkinter.</p>
<p>When PAGE generates the code for a window, all of the code for causing
Python to create and map that window is generated - a Python class for
the toplevel window with all the code necessary to instantiate the
class (i. e., display the window), import statements, Tk mainloop and
initialization, a main procedure, etc.  Therefore, if you have
provided the skeletal callbacks the generated code is executable and
you can see just how the GUI will look in a Python environment. PAGE
even attempts to generate skeletal callbacks. As mentioned above the
generated code resides in two modules.</p>
<p>The generated code can be used as the skeleton for your application.
However, the generated GUI may be a secondary GUI and all that you
really want to do is instantiate the toplevel class, use support
functions implied within the GUI and possibly to destroy that window.
You can do that by importing the code as a module and invoking
functions within that module including automatically generated
functions for creation and destruction of the window. This will be
discussed in more detail later.</p>
<p>I often use the generated GUI classes as starting points for
customization. When you are not sure how to start or want to quickly
try out some GUI ideas, PAGE is very useful because it generates all of
the boilerplate necessary.</p>
<p>PAGE is invoked by executing the &#8220;page&#8221; script located in the page
directory. I go to that directory and issue the command:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">./</span><span class="n">page</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>I preface the command with &#8221;./&#8221; to be sure I am executing the page
script in the page directory. By including &#8220;page&#8221; in the PATH
environmental variable, one can work in any directory.</p>
<p>PAGE can be invoked with zero or one file names.  If supplied the file
name should have an extension of &#8221;.tcl&#8221; and the file should exist.  If
another extension is supplied that is interpreted as an error and PAGE
terminates. If no extension is given in the file name or the file name
ends in &#8221;.&#8221; , an extension of &#8221;.tcl&#8221; is assumed by PAGE. If the file
cannot be found PAGE terminates because PAGE expects a file generated
by PAGE.  If a file name is specified, the file should be a tcl file
saved during a previous PAGE session; it will be opened as PAGE begins
executing as an alternative to File-&gt;Open for proceeding from a saved
PAGE session.  Near the top of a &#8221;.tcl&#8221; design file created in PAGE
there is a comment containing version information and a timestamp. If
that version information is not present then PAGE will refuse to open
the file.</p>
<p>As you use PAGE to build a GUI, you can save the current state of the
GUI at any time from the File-&gt;Save of File-&gt;Save As menu.  In fact,
it is a good idea to save your status often in case PAGE fails or
dies.</p>
<p>I am sometimes exasperated in PAGE because so many functions can be
performed several ways.</p>
<div class="section" id="overview">
<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section attempts to describe the main functionality of PAGE when
building an application with a single root window. It will yield a
Python module which implements the application interface.</p>
<p>One uses PAGE to generate a GUI as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Start PAGE by executing &#8220;page&#8221; or activating the PAGE icon on
the Windows desktop. In Windows one may also start PAGE from the
command line by going to the installation directory and executing
winpage.bat.</li>
<li>Create the new top window by selecting the
top left button in the widget toolbar.</li>
<li>Drag the toplevel window to where you want it.</li>
<li>Resize the toplevel window by dragging a handle at the corners or edges.</li>
<li>Change the title by changing the title attribute in the Attribute Editor.</li>
<li>Add a menu to the top level using the Menu Editor entered from
Widget-&gt;Edit Menu in the main menu.</li>
<li>Drag appropriate widgets from the tool bar to the toplevel window or
other previously placed container widgets.</li>
<li>As desired to make the generated code more readable, specify an
unique alias for the widget.</li>
<li>Adjust properties of the widgets and the toplevel window as desired.
Some of those properties will include specification of functions to
support the GUI such as to load list box, or to respond to mouse
selection, etc. Included can be the specifications of event bindings.</li>
<li>Use the function definition facilities to specify the necessary
functions and use the bind specification facilities to bind events to
functions.</li>
<li>When the window has the appearance that you want, select
Gen_Python-&gt;Generate Support Module. A new window will appear and fill
with the skeleton functions and the definitions of the Tkinter variables.
Save the source window of the python console.</li>
<li>Then select Gen_Python-&gt;Generate Python GUI from the main menu.  A
new window, a Python Console will open and fill with the Python
code, which I call the GUI module. To generate the support module
select Gen_Python-&gt;Generate Support Module, which creates and fills
another Python Console with the generated skeleton support module.</li>
<li>You can save the code in  one or both of the Python modules and then
try executing the GUI module to see if you like what you have designed.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="placing-and-modifying-widgets">
<h2>Placing and Modifying Widgets<a class="headerlink" href="#placing-and-modifying-widgets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="toplevel-geometry">
<h3>Toplevel Geometry<a class="headerlink" href="#toplevel-geometry" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>PAGE generates a single Toplevel Tk window which is the users GUI for
his application. (One can have multiple GUI windows; see
<a class="reference internal" href="#applications-with-multiple-top-level-windows"><em>Applications with Multiple Top-Level Windows</em></a>.)
As elsewhere with Tk and PAGE, there is more than one way to specify
where the GUI window will appear on the application user&#8217;s
screen.</p>
<p>Prior to release 4.5, the PAGE user would select the Toplevel button
in the Widget Toolbar and a toplevel window would appear on the
screen. As well as filling in subwidgets the user could drag the
toplevel widget to the desired screen location and also could adjust
its size.  When the Python code was generated it would contain code
that would place the GUI at the exact spot specified.  If you had
placed it at pixel specification +1000+300, it would end up 1000
pixels from the upper left corner and 300 pixels down.</p>
<p>With version 4.5, the Python code generation addresses the toplevel
placement with a new attribute - &#8220;default origin&#8221;.</p>
<p>The &#8220;default origin&#8221; preference, if selected will cause the generated
Python GUI window to placed on the screen at the default location as
determined by the system window manager.  If false, the location will
be determined from where the toplevel window is placed in PAGE. The
default for the this attribute is false, but can be changed by means
of the Preferences mechanism. A default of false will cause PAGE to
behave as before. Unfortunately, I was faced with an unclear mnemonic
in the Attribute Editor or a double negative; I chose the latter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="adding-widgets">
<h3>Adding Widgets<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-widgets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>All that is necessary to add a widget to the GUI is to select it with
Button-1 from the Widget Toolbar, position the cursor inside the
destination container and again press the Button-1.  A small version
of the widget will appear with its upper left-hand corner at the point
of the Button-1 click.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="aliases">
<h3>Aliases<a class="headerlink" href="#aliases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Often algorithmically generated names can be difficult to understand
in computer generated code.  To reduce the problem in PAGE, users can
specify more easily understood names called aliases.</p>
<p>An alias is a user specified identifier of a widget in the generated
code. Obviously, aliases must be unique within the class which will be
generated in the python code to realize the GUI window.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>An easy way to specify an alias is to select the target widget with
a Button-3 click and then select &#8220;Set Alias ...&#8221;.  Another small
window will appear and one can add the alias. Finally close that
window by selecting the &#8220;check&#8221; or with the Enter key.</li>
<li>Another way to enter an alias is to select a widget with Button-1
and then select &#8220;Set Alias ...&#8221; from the Option menu in the main
PAGE window.</li>
<li>Also, one may specify an alias by selecting a widget and editing the
&#8220;Alias&#8221; field in the top section of the Attribute Editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>An alias must be a legal python identifier.  PAGE does allow blanks
in an alias but they will be changed to &#8220;_&#8221;.  Also Alias has no
meaning for top level windows.  For top level windows the the variable
names are generated from the title attribute. There are numerous
schemes for generating such names but one that has been suggested is
based on CamelCase. It is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Buttons could start with &#8216;btn&#8217;,  i.e. btnQuit, btnNew, etc.</li>
<li>Entry boxes could start with &#8216;txt&#8217;, i.e.  txtFirstName, etc.</li>
<li>Check boxes could start with &#8216;chk&#8217; I.E. chkDoThis, etc.</li>
<li>Radio Buttons could start with &#8216;rdo&#8217; or &#8216;rbtn&#8217;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that PAGE has an option to automatically generate
aliases.  These aliases are algorithmically generated name but are
more readable than the default
generated names.  This is controlled by a new field in the Preference
window.  I recommend that you go
into Preferences, check the value and save the preferences.  Why the
original Visual Tcl program had two methods of generating names, one
comprehensible and one not, but chose the less readable one as
the default is baffling.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="selecting-and-modifying-a-widget">
<h3>Selecting and Modifying a Widget<a class="headerlink" href="#selecting-and-modifying-a-widget" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are several ways to select a widget for modification and I don&#8217;t
want to keep repeating the variations through out this document.</p>
<p>For simple widgets like buttons or text boxes you can select the widget
either by selecting the widget with Button-1 in the GUI or in the
Widget Tree.</p>
<p>With more complex widgets like notebooks, paned windows, or scrolled
widgets, clicking Button-1 inside the widget will select a child
widget rather than the whole widget.  The widget may be selected with
Control-Button-1. Alternatively, the widget may be selected with
Button-1 in the Widget Tree. When dragging the widget or a handle hold
down the control key.</p>
<p>Once selected there are several ways to modify the widget.
:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A selected widget may be moved by dragging the widget or resized by
dragging a handle. When the mouse is over a handle, it turns red.</li>
<li>Attributes can be changed in the Attribute Editor. Geometric
attributes can be changed Attribute Editor also</li>
<li>Some changes can be made using the Widget Menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are working with standard Tcl widgets, there are many options
that can be modified whereas the ttk widgets have very few options,
their appearance being governed principally by the specified theme.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fill-container">
<h3>Fill Container<a class="headerlink" href="#fill-container" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>&#8220;Fill Container&#8221; is a feature that was added in version 4.8 and causes
the selected widget to expand to fill its container provided that
there are no other widgets already in the container. This function is
restricted to those widgets for which I think it makes sense, like
frames, notebooks, scrolled widgets, canvases as well as text and list
boxes.</p>
<p>To use this feature activate the Widget popup menu with Button-3 over
the widget itself or an entry in the Widget Tree and select
&#8220;Fill Container&#8221; from the widget submenu.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cut-copy-and-paste">
<h2>Cut, Copy, and Paste<a class="headerlink" href="#cut-copy-and-paste" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After much work I think that there is now a useful cut, copy, and
paste feature in PAGE.  The basic way it works:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Select the widget you want to paste in a new spot or container by
selecting it as you would for just plain moving it.</li>
<li>With Widget Menu and select with Button-1 Cut or Copy as you want.</li>
<li>In the Widget Menu select Paste or use Control-V or select Paste
from the Main menu -&gt; Edit.</li>
<li>Move the mouse to the desired insertion point and click Button-1.</li>
</ol>
<p>Copy and Paste are important features because one cannot drag a widget
from one container widget into another but one can cut or copy and
paste to get that effect.  For instance if one creates a button in a
top level window and then decides that it should be moved to a frame
or a notebook tab, that cannot be accomplished that just by selecting
the button and dragging it to the frame. However it can be done with
cut and paste.</p>
<p>When doing cut-copy-paste I make fewer mistakes by selecting the
widget the Widget Tree than trying to grab it in the top level window.
Correct selection is crucial important when trying to select and copy
nested widgets.</p>
<p>I have implemented cut and it appears to work; however, I never use
it. There is a sequence of several steps between the selecting copy
from the menu and selecting the location of the paste.  If you get it
wrong following a cut, you can&#8217;t go back and retry the operation; the
source for the copying is gone. So, I stick to copy and paste and then
finish with a delete.</p>
<p>One thing that cut, copy, and paste cannot do is copy from one
module&#8217;s GUI and paste in another module&#8217;s GUI.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="widget-menu">
<h2>Widget Menu<a class="headerlink" href="#widget-menu" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Widget Menu, which appears in more than one place including the
main menu as well as the drop menu in the Widget Tree or a top level
window, provides a convenient way to modify some of the widget
attributes. The drop menu is activated with Button-3 applied to the
selected widget and its features are dependent on and apply to the
widget selected. It is seen below:</p>
<img alt="_images/widget-menu.png" src="_images/widget-menu.png" />
<p>In the case above the widget submenu allows one to easily specify the text
attribute and for specifying multiple line text labels.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="linking-events-to-actions">
<h2>Linking Events to Actions<a class="headerlink" href="#linking-events-to-actions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I will not try to explain event binding fully for Tk and Tkinter. I have
read several books and many web pages on the subject but feel little
mastery.</p>
<p>The point of building a GUI is to link actions (the execution of
specific code) to some event within the GUI like selecting a button
with a mouse key, typing a particular character into a text field, or
resizing window a widget.
Binding events to widgets is a very confusing aspect of using Tk and
Tkinter.
Tk implements a global binding hierarchy in that
Tk allows one to create bindings between</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>events and a particular widgets such mouse selection and a
particular button,</li>
<li>events and particular classes of widgets such as mouse selection and
all buttons in an application,</li>
<li>events and all widgets in a
toplevel window, and</li>
<li>events and all the widgets in an
application.</li>
</ol>
<p>PAGE really assists in only the first type of binding. At least one
respected documenter recommends against using the other three.</p>
<p>Grayson, in his book talks about invoking callbacks directly or
indirectly. Specifying a command attribute leads an indirect invocation
while specifying a bind command leads to a direct invocation. The
difference is that the direct invocation passes an event object to the
callback and the callback function must have an argument list which
includes a parameter for the event. To see examples of direct and
indirect invocation of callbacks see the vrex example or the bind example.
One could also characterize them as clear and confusing, or easy and complex.
Let me discuss the easy case first, that of specifying a a command attribute.</p>
<p>Many widgets have a command attribute which specifies the code to
executed when the widget is selected with Button-1.
This is a simplified way of binding for the common case of selecting
the widget with Button-1.
While
Tk allows one to specify a block of code, one must
stick with a function name in Python.
For example, setting the command attribute
of a button to &#8220;foo&#8221; so that selecting the button will cause the
invocation of the function &#8220;foo&#8221; with no arguments.</p>
<p>If you want to invoke a function and pass parameters to it, you use a
lambda expression. Please see section 6.4 of Grayson&#8217;s book for a fine
explanation of the use of lambda expressions in this context.
(In a nutshell, if Python see a function name followed by parenthesis
it will try to execute immediately, whereas the execution is desired
when the event occurs.)
Let say
that if you want to call the function foo and pass it 3 as an
argument, what you enter as command is</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>not</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>or to pass a variable parameter</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>not</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To specify such a command, one selects the widget and then in the
Attribute Editor enters the command in the Command field. In keeping
with the Virtual Tcl style of having too many ways of doing most things, an
alternative is to select the widget in the Widget Tree with Button-3
and then Widget-&gt;Set Command. I don&#8217;t use the alternate method very
often. I would probably forget it but for this paragraph.</p>
<p>So much for the binding of the easy case which essentially defines a
configuration command for setting the command attribute of a widget in
the generated Python.
For binding other events to widgets I point you to the Bindings Window
which essentially builds a bind command. Of course, the bind command
could be manually coded in init function of the support module.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bindings-window">
<h2>Bindings Window<a class="headerlink" href="#bindings-window" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are many events that can be linked to code. See the Tk man pages
and Chapter 6 of Grayson. They include responding to the different
mouse button pressings or releases, a window getting or loosing focus,
etc. as well as virtual events. Bind is the command for linking one of
these events to code and is accomplished by using the Bindings Window.
Here the code must be a lambda expression because it pass an event
object containing much useful information to the
callback. Consequently, the callback function must have an event
parameter in its argument list.</p>
<p>The Bindings Window can be opened by selecting the widget with
Button-3 and the selecting Bindings... from the popup menu. Basically,</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>select the widget in the left column if not already selected,</li>
<li>Insert the desired event from the Insert menu,</li>
<li>select the item in the left column, and</li>
<li>fill in prototype lambda expression in the right hand column.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Bindings Window can be opened either from the popup menus in
response to selecting the widget with Button-3 or selecting the widget
with Button-1 and typing Alt-b. Then select Insert from the menu to
put the event in to the left pane.  Finally insert the desired code in
the right pane where a template will appear.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s clarify that and look again at</p>
<img alt="_images/binding.png" src="_images/binding.png" />
<p>In the left column you will see the Tcl name of the selected widget and
below the name a list, initially empty) of the events already bound to
the widget.  In the image two events have already been bound, one of
which is a user defined virtual event, &#8220;&lt;&lt;Bingo&gt;&gt;&#8221;.
Following the event information of the selected widget is a bunch of
information about the bind hierarchy related to the selected widget. I
have not found any use for that stuff.</p>
<p>Two things can be accomplished with the Binding Window are</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>define a new binding for the selected widget The key action for
the first is to insert a new event. It is done by clicking Insert
Menu and selecting one of the actions there.</li>
<li>modify the lambda expression of an existing binding in the obvious
way.</li>
</ol>
<p>Selecting Insert yields</p>
<img alt="_images/insert-bind.png" src="_images/insert-bind.png" />
<p>If you do not find the action you can select Advanced ...</p>
<img alt="_images/advanced-bind.png" src="_images/advanced-bind.png" />
<p>Here you are presented with a wide selection of possibilities.</p>
<p>First, if you want the event to be the pressing of the key c, select
the entry box at the top and type &#8220;c&#8221;; the event &#8220;&lt;Key-c&gt;&#8221; appears in
the Event entry box near the bottom. If you want to modify the event
to require the control key at the same time, select Control from the
right column and the event becomes &#8220;&lt;Control-Key-c&gt;&#8221;.</p>
<p>For events other than a key press event, then select an event from
the left column.  The list of events there is more or less every event
Tk knows about. I know of no way of listing only those events to which
a particular widget will respond, so I can&#8217;t prune the list.</p>
<p>Again, the selected event may be modified by picking a modifier from
the right column. Notice that the left column contains all of the
virtual events that Tk know about. If you are going to generate a new
virtual event, say &lt;&lt;Bingo&gt;&gt;, you can add that to the Event entry box
manually.</p>
<p>Having now composed your event, you can select the &#8220;Add&#8221; button
which will close the insert window and add the event to the left
column of the Binding Window.</p>
<p>The penultimate step is to appropriately change the skeletal code in
the right column. Basically, just add parameters and supply the
callback function name in place of &#8220;xxx&#8221;. Finally, save the result by
selecting the check button.  This is similar to the situation with the
command already discussed.</p>
<p>The big difference here is that the callback is always passed a
parameter, the event object, and so a lambda expression is needed to
pass that object or any parameters to the callback function.  This
means that the command for passing the event object (with no user
parameters) is:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">foo_bar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">e</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>or if passing user parameters:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">foo_bar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">e</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>A couple of points need mentioning. First, the Binding Window contains
a lot of cruft below the event entries for the selected widget which I
don&#8217;t understand and can&#8217;t use. It seems to be a listing default events for the
binding hierarchy of the widgets alluded to above. I am toying with
just removing it. In addition I have never done anything good with the
buttons below the menubar except for the check button. I might
dispense with them also. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>With version 4.8, Custom Widgets were introduced. Since PAGE knows
nothing of those widgets including binding possibilities, the
mechanism just described cannot be used to specified bindings for such
widgets. You will have to do that in the support module.</p>

<span id="id2"></span><h2>Defining Functions<a class="headerlink" href="#defining-functions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you name a function in a menu, an event binding, command attribute,
etc., then definition of that function is required before trying to
execute the GUI in PAGE.</p>
<p>Executing the GUI means to execute the generated Python code within
PAGE to demonstrate how the GUI will appear in the completed
application by selecting the Run button on the Python Console.  To
satisfy requirements of the Python interpreter Tkinter variables and
callback functions have to
be defined. Skeleton functions will be satisfactory
since at that state of development you really don&#8217;t expect the
application to usefully function.</p>
<p>One path for the user is to do nothing, letting PAGE create a skeleton for
you by just noticing that the a name is specified in a binding or an
attribute in the support module as described in <a class="reference internal" href="rework.html#rework"><em>Rework</em></a>.  This
is the recommended approach as of version 4.2.</p>
<p>I usually just let PAGE generate the skeleton functions, run the
resulting code to see what my window will look like and then do the
rest of my programming in emacs. When PAGE stores the python modules,
several layers of backup files are retained.  If I need to regress to
one of them, I find that <a class="reference external" href="http://meldmerge.org">Meld</a> is a
wonderful utility for managing the differences between versions.</p>

<div class="section" id="toplevel-widget">
<h3>Toplevel Widget<a class="headerlink" href="#toplevel-widget" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Toplevel widgets don&#8217;t really have a title property. It was added in
Visual Tcl and the Attribute Editor originally displayed it as one of
the geometry attributes. That didn&#8217;t seem like a good place so I moved
it to the Attributes section.  The title is displayed at top of the
window and is used with &#8220;_&#8220;&#8216;s replacing blanks, as the name of the
generated Python class.</p>
<p>It never occurred to me that a user might want a null title to a
toplevel window. However, one user tried that and reported a bug so
version 4.8.10 allows one to set the title field in the Attribute
Editor to null. The name of the class implementing a toplevel window
is based on the window title. So in the case of a null title, the
class name used is the alias specified for the toplevel widget.</p>
<p>Among the attributes listed for a toplevel widget is &#8216;menu&#8217; which in
PAGE allows one to easily create  a menubar at the top
of the widget. Click on the attribute and follow the procedure below.</p>
<p>An improvement in version 3.5 was the ability to change other
properties such as the colors and the cursor of Toplevel widgets. One
property of Toplevel widgets is relief.  However, I was totally unable
to change that property at either the Python or Tcl/Tk level.  I
simply don&#8217;t know how.</p>
<p>With version 4.8.6, the Toplevel widget may be deleted by closing the
window in PAGE with the delete control button in the window title bar
or Alt-F4. Since only one Toplevel widget is allow in PAGE this has
the effect of restarting the design session.</p>

<div class="section" id="relative-placement">
<span id="relative"></span><h3>Relative Placement<a class="headerlink" href="#relative-placement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Following the paradigm I am familiar with from VB, PAGE uses the place
window manager to fix location within the generated GUI.  Thanks to
George Tellalov, who suggested using relative placement for widgets
within the GUI thus allowing one to build stretchable GUI&#8217;s.  They
allow one to grab an edge or corner of the executing Python GUI and
change its size and while maintaining relative positions and sizes of
the internal widgets. This is the default behavior. Keep in mind that
with relative placement, widgets may change size as the toplevel
window is resized, but fonts do not change size.</p>
<p>Since I don&#8217;t think buttons or labels should change size in step with
the change in size of the window, relative placement for buttons does
not change the size of buttons but the relative placement is
maintained.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tkinter-variable-classes">
<h3>Tkinter Variable Classes<a class="headerlink" href="#tkinter-variable-classes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>With several of the widgets using variable to set or reflect values,
it is necessary to have linkage between tkinter variables and Python
variables.  For instance, when one moves a slider of a scale in the
GUI window, he wants the value to be reflected in a Python variable or
conversely changing that variable should change the position of the
slider. This is done by means of the Tkinter variable classes:
BooleanVar, DoubleVar, IntVar, and StringVar.</p>
<p>You need an instance of one of these classes. PAGE guesses the variable
type which you may need. You can then use the get method in Python to
determine the value of the variable in tk and use the set method to
set the value of the tk variable.  There are examples below.  For more
information see the <a class="reference external" href="http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/variable.htm">Tkinter Variable Class</a> on the effbot.org web
page.</p>
<p>For instance if you are using a TScale widget to be coupled with the
tk variable variable &#8220;val&#8221;:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">set_Tk_var</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">global</span> <span class="n">val</span>
    <span class="n">val</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">DoubleVar</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">val</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>   <span class="c1"># Initial value to be displayed.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>then you need to set the TScale attribute to &#8220;val&#8221;.  The rule is that
the Tkinter variable must exist before it the widget class is
instantiated. It may appear in the toplevel class definition like:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">che26</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">configure</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">variable</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">var</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When val is changed</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">val</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">14</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>the TScale will move to that value.</p>
<p>If the TScale is changed in the GUI, you can read the new value with</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">val</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>PAGE tries to help out by generating an instance of the appropriate
global class variables as needed in the support module.  Again, this is skeletal code to
help the generated Python code run from within the Python Console. It
recognizes that a variable starting with &#8220;self.&#8221; is a class variable.
Again, I do not use these support variables because I think that the
generated Python is less clear.</p>

problems with their implementation and documentations.  I will try to

<div class="section" id="scrolled-widgets">
<h3>Scrolled Widgets<a class="headerlink" href="#scrolled-widgets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For some reason that I don&#8217;t understand, the Tk folks have never seen
fit to implement scrolled widgets such as a Scrolled Text widget. I
certainly don&#8217;t want to fuss around with all the separate programming
tasks required for build a scrolled text widget when building a GUI.</p>
<p>I am especially pleased that Guilherme Polo in his Pyttk-samples
package shows how to build Scrolledtext and Scrolledtreeview
widgets. Borrowing that code, I was able to include such widgets as
well as a Scrolledlistbox in PAGE.</p>
<p>One can select a scrolled widget from the Widget Toolbar and place it
in the GUI and PAGE will include all of the Python support coded
necessary to realize the scrolled widget. The scrolled widgets that I
added are not named with an T because they are not official ttk
widgets. The Scrolledtextbox has a normal text subwidget in which I
have chosen to make the &#8220;wrap&#8221; default &#8220;none&#8221;.</p>
<p>Although Polo implemented his code with ttk widgets, I have used his
ideas to implement scrolled tk widgets as well. In fact, where
possible I have used tk widgets in preference to ttk widgets. For
instance, I have based only the ScrolledTreeview and Scrolledcombobox
on ttk widgets. I am indebted to Polo for his ideas but he bears no
responsibility for any errors I make interpreting his ideas.</p>
<p>The scrolled widgets are compound widgets containing as-needed
scrollbars and an elementary widget. As such, to set attributes or
apply bindings, first select the elementary internal widget.</p>
<p>When the scrolled widgets are placed into a container window, the
image shown displays vertical scroll bars to facilitate
identification. The best is that the appearance is similar to that
which is shown when the GUI is executed because as implemented in the
Python code the scroll bars appear only when required. I had a lot of
trouble with background colors in the ttk::scrollbars used in the
Python GUI.</p>
<p>These widgets are complex widgets, so to move or resize them, use
Control with Button-1. The scrollbars are ttk::scrollbar widgets which
appear only when needed, i. e., when an item extends beyond the
allotted space.</p>
<p>When inserting text inside a Scrolledtext widget, treat it like a text
widget. For example, uses code like</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Scrolledtext1</span>
<span class="n">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">insert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">END</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;This is text to be inserted&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When  cutting, or copying scrolled widgets, I use the widget tree for
easily selecting the whole widget rather than just the interior widget.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ttk-notebook">
<h3>Ttk Notebook<a class="headerlink" href="#ttk-notebook" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you select, place, and resize a TNotebook in
your GUI window it will display two pages and look like:</p>
<img alt="_images/notebook.jpg" src="_images/notebook.jpg" />
<p>To change the attributes of the TNotebook, select the notebook editor either
by invoking Control-Button-1 in the widget and then selecting edit
page from the Widget menu or by selecting it in the Widget Tree with
Button-3 and then the Widget entry in the popup menu.</p>
<img alt="_images/edit-pages.jpg" src="_images/edit-pages.jpg" />
<p>Here you can do all sorts of interesting things like change the text
in the tab and select the tab you want to activate for adding widgets
or changing attributes of widgets already added to that page. If you
go to the menu Item-&gt;Add, it will create a new page to the
notebook, in the above example, between Page 1 and Page 2.  The Move
menu as well as the up and down buttons will change the order of the
pages.  The move operation will move the selected page one position up
or down.  The move is circular in the sense that moving the bottom
item down will move it to the top, etc..</p>
<p>Another way of navigating the pages is the pages attribute in the
Attribute Editor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ttk-panedwindow">
<h3>Ttk Panedwindow<a class="headerlink" href="#ttk-panedwindow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The TPanedwindow can be added to the GUI by selecting it from the
Widget Toolbar and then Button-1 in the container.  There are two
entries for the TPainedwindow, one for vertical separators and another
for horizontal, in the Widget Toolbar.  It can be moved around by
Control-Button-1 and resized by dragging one of the handles. It is
sometimes a bit difficult grabbing a handle unless you select the
TPanedwindow widget from the Widget Tree window. Each pane of the
paned window contains a TLableframe which fills the pane.  Using the
label frame was the only way I could find to actually get the a
TPanedwindow to appear on my screen. Again, I had few examples to work
from.</p>
<p>The paned window is configured by invoking Widget-&gt;Edit Panes menu
item bringing up the following editor.</p>
<img alt="_images/edit-panes.jpg" src="_images/edit-panes.jpg" />
<p>This editor allows users to move among the panes, change the text in
the label frame, and to manipulate the position of the sash between
the current frame and the next one.    You can set the sash position as a
percentage of the total size of paned window.  Again, one saves the
changes by clicking on the green check.</p>
<p>With version 3.2, one can select the TLableframe defining the pane and
drag the edge of it to change the sash position. In other words,
select a pane with Button-1 and drag one of the interior handle; that
will move the sash between the selected pane and the adjacent pane.</p>
<p>The Edit panes window allows one to add additional panes to the window
via the Item menu. The implementation of paned windows sets the
initial size of the paned window to 200x200 pixels and the the first
pane size to 75 pixels.  Adding a new pane adds one at the end (the
right end of a horizontal TPanedwindow or the bottom of a vertical
TPanedwindow, in either case, taking space from prior end pane.
Fortunately you can resize the whole TPanedwindow which changes the
size of the end pane. Then resize the others by changing the sash
positions as described above.</p>
<p>The editor, by including the Move menu and the little up and down
arrows allows one can move the a pane to a new position. Again, the
move operation is circular.</p>
<p>To move a paned window select the whole window then a spot in a sash
between panes and then you can drag the whole paned window.</p>

<h3>Ttk Treeview<a class="headerlink" href="#ttk-treeview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It was  difficult to provide reasonably good support for the
Treeview widget. I actually do not support the ttk::treeview widget,
rather I have gone directly to the Scrolledtreeview which embeds the
ttk::treeview widget in a ttk::frame with auto-scrolling scrollbars.</p>
<p>What I have been able to do is to support the placement of the widget
in a window with a default of one column in addition to the tree
column both columns are stretchable. By invoking the column editor you
may change many of the characteristics of the widget such as the
column size and heading, as well as the number of columns. It also
allows one to reorder the columns.  Note that the column that contains
the tree has the index of &#8220;#0&#8221; and must remain the first (left-most)
column.  The column editor is invoked with Button-3 in the widget and
going to Widget-&gt;Edit Columns ... as shown below:</p>
<img alt="_images/column-editor.png" src="_images/column-editor.png" />
<p>If the widget were created or a column is added with the configuration
option &#8220;stretch&#8221; is set to 0 (not stretchable), then when the
resulting GUI is stretched then the column width will not change.  The
enclosing widget with the scrollbars will either have a blank area to
the right of the last column if the window is enlarged or the last
column will not fully show.  To get the more desirable behavior, go
into the Column Editor in the Widget menu and make at least one of the
columns stretchable.</p>

<h3>Ttk Entry<a class="headerlink" href="#ttk-entry" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>While I do support the ttk entry widget, I don&#8217;t see any reason to
recommend using it because I am unable to change the widgets font and
I don&#8217;t like being stuck with the TkDefaultFont. Strange to say the
ttk Combobox, below, is rumored to be based on the TEntry widget and I
am able to manipulate the font size using the style facility.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ttk-combobox">
<h3>Ttk Combobox<a class="headerlink" href="#ttk-combobox" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The combobox requires a list of selectable values to display in the
drop-down listbox.  These are easily specified from the Set Values
entry of the Widget menu. When invoked from the menu a scrolled text
box appears and the values are specified by entering them one per line
in the text box and then selecting the check mark. The user should
include strings as they should appear in the Python code. That means
if they are string literals, then they should be enclosed in quotes as
shown in the example below. If the quoting is not present it is
assumed that they are variables. I do not want to get into the morass
of entry parsing literal strings.</p>
<img alt="_images/SetValues.png" src="_images/SetValues.png" />
<p>Values can also be set in the &#8220;init&#8221; function in support module using
code like:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">w</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">TCombobox1</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;values&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;USA&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Canada&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Australia&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>My style problem with the TCombobox is that while I can use the style
mechanism to change the font of the entry field in the combobox I
have not found a way to change the font of the drop down area
containing the values. In addition, I have not found a mechanism for
changing the values in the drop down list after initialization.</p>

<div class="section" id="radiobuttons">
<h3>Radiobuttons<a class="headerlink" href="#radiobuttons" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>TRadiobuttons and Radiobuttons act pretty much the same. One specifies
several of the widgets which are linked by specifying the same
Tkinter variable for all. It is necessary to specify a different value for
each radiobutton. One can also specify an initial value for the
group. For TRadiobuttons the values and variables can be specified
from the Widget menu as well as in the Attribute editor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="strangeness-with-text-and-variables">
<h3>Strangeness with Text and Variables<a class="headerlink" href="#strangeness-with-text-and-variables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I was surprised to discover a couple of strange things about the way
text is handled with ttk widgets.  There are several ttk widgets,
among them TButton, TMenubutton, Tlabel, TCheckbuttom, and
Tradiobutton, which have both properties of &#8220;-text&#8221; and
&#8220;-variable&#8221;. Using the Attribute Editor you can specify the value of
the Text to be displayed in PAGE when you are laying out the
GUI. However, if you then specify the variable attribute, the text
attribute is changed to the zero length string.  I guess that that is
because the variable you named is undefined.  But also the width of
the field containing the text may be set to zero length. So, for
instance, Tlables appear to have zero width unless you have changed
the width prior to specifying the variable.  A Tbutton merely displays
blank text and TRadiobuttons squeezes down to just the
button. TCheckbuttons behaves similarly to TRadiobuttons.</p>
<p>When you generate the Python code the widgets will again appear to
have no text and maybe have no width unless you have set a non blank
value into the Tkinter variable. Tk widgets including Button, Message,
Label, Checkbutton, and Radiobutton behave much the same way.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="label">
<h3>Label<a class="headerlink" href="#label" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Label widgets also treat text in an unexpected way.  The justify
attribute applies how multiple lines of text are aligned relative to
each other, it does not set how text lines are placed relative to the
Label widget boundaries.  Use the anchor attribute to specify if the
text block is up against the left of the widget (anchor &#8216;e&#8217;) or the
right (anchor &#8216;w&#8217;).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="listbox">
<h3>Listbox<a class="headerlink" href="#listbox" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Listbox widget has the option &#8220;listvariable&#8221; which one would expect to
behave exactly like one of the Tkinter variable classes.  However, the Tcl
documentation specifies that the listvariable must contain a list of
values to be displayed in the listbox and the possible Tkinter
variable classes are BooleanVar, StringVar, IntVar, and DoubleVar.  By
experimentation I have found that by specifying the var to be
StringVar and setting its value to a tuple of strings will cause each
member of the tuple to appear as an entry in the listbox.  I am rather
surprised at this but glad to find something that works.</p>
<p>The following code</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">set_Tk_var</span><span class="p">():</span>

<div class="section" id="scale-and-tscale">
<h3>Scale and TScale<a class="headerlink" href="#scale-and-tscale" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Tk does strange things when one tries to modify the narrow dimension
of a scale widget (the height of a horizontal scale or the width of a
vertical one).  So PAGE does not allow one to modify the narrow
dimension during the design phase and restricts the Relative Placement
in the Python code to prevent changes in the narrow dimension.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id3">
<h3>Scrolled Widgets<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To change attributes of the widget being scrolled, it is necessary to
select that widget from the Widget Tree and then make the desired
changes in the Attribute Editor. For instance, to change the
background color of a Scrolledtext widget, select the text widget
indented under the Scrolledtext entry in Widget Tree.</p>
<p>The several scrolled widgets provide auto-scaling; that is when the
widget is actually larger than the viewing area scrollbars are
shown. However, there is no way for the user to change any attributes
of the scrollbars.  The primarily affects the background color which
is the GUI background color which is set in the preferences.</p>

<div class="section" id="sizegrip">
<h3>Sizegrip<a class="headerlink" href="#sizegrip" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Support for the ttk::sizegrip widget was included in Version 4.0.
Merely select the widget from the Widget Toolbar and drop it anywhere
within the Toplevel frame but not on top of another widget; it will
bounce to the lower right corner.  Were you to drop it on say a
notebook widget, a weird result would occur like landing in the wrong
place but doing the right thing.</p>
<p>I had difficulties with using Sizegrip with PAGE windows.  It works
fine with the Python Console and the Menu Editor, but I never got a
truly satisfactory result with Widget Tree or or the Widget Toolbar.
I left it with the Widget Toolbar but not with the Widget tree. To be

<div class="section" id="custom-widget">
<h3>Custom Widget<a class="headerlink" href="#custom-widget" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In writing a photo manager, I needed a variation of a scrolled canvas
to display photos.  I could not find a general purpose candidate for a
scrolled canvas widget, but a found several variations on the web that might
work. So I implemented a Custom widget that can be manipulate in PAGE
but requires the user to supply the Python implementation. So if I
have left something out and you can conjure a tkinter implementation
of it, page can handle it.</p>
<p>PAGE shows a Custom
widget as a Text widget which can be placed and resized like any other
widget. However since the widget has not been defined within PAGE, it is
meaningless to talk about modifying attributes. (It is shown as a
Text widget with the caption &#8220;Custom widget&#8221;.) The generated Python refers to
it as a class defined in the support module.  To allow execution of
the GUI before the support module is completed, there is included in
the support modle the line:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Custom</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Frame</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>which is followed with user code.</p>
<p>The user then inserts his code for the custom widgets as a class with
the &lt;class_name&gt; of his choosing and follows that code with the line:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Custom</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">class_name</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

<h3>Creating and Saving Code Modules<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-and-saving-code-modules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This section discusses the creation and saving of the GUI module and
the support module. I want to make saving simple and intuitive while
reducing the probability of inadvertently overwriting hard to
reproduce code, particularly in the support module.  At the same time
I did not want to bombard the user with &#8220;Are you sure ...&#8221;
dialogues. These goals are somewhat contradictory. I would appreciate
comments on this subject.</p>
<p>When one chooses to generate the GUI module (Control-P):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The constructed GUI is transformed into a Tcl file and saved if the GUI has changed in the current session.</li>
<li>The GUI is also transformed into a Python module called the GUI module and displayed in the <a class="reference internal" href="interface.html#python-console"><em>Python Console</em></a> but is not automatically saved. This is to allow the user to peruse the code before committing it to storage.  The user may even change the code since the Python Console code window is a Tk text widget which rudimentary editing capability.</li>
<li>From the Python Console, the user can  select the Save button and the GUI module will be saved if &#8220;new&#8221; or changed.  Repeatedly selecting the Save button without changing the code will not result in additional actual saves.</li>
<li>From the Python Console, the user can select the Run button which provides the same function as the Save button but also attempts to execute the GUI module, if there is an existing support module.</li>
</ul>
<p>When one chooses to generate the Support module (Control-U):</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The constructed GUI is transformed into a Tcl file and saved if the GUI has changed in the current session.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If there is no existing support module, then one is generated and displayed in a Python Console.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If there is an existing support module, action is a bit more elaborate. First, the existing support module is analyzed to see what Tkinter variable and functions are defined in the existing module and compared with those which would be defined in a new support module. Next, the user is given the choice</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>use the existing support module, thereby preserving your hand written code,</li>
<li>generate a new support module,</li>
<li>update the existing support module updated to include the additional Tkinter variable and skeleton functions.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">From the Python Console, the user can select the Save button and the

</li>
<li><p class="first">From the Python Console, the user can select the Run button which provides the same function as the Save button but also attempts to execute the GUI module.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important that the support file is not automatically saved when
run is invoked.
.. Since most of the handwritten code of the application
.. will reside in the support module, it is only saved when explicitly
.. requested.
I don&#8217;t want PAGE to inadvertently trash your handwritten
application code.  The Python Console has a label which will indicates when the code window has been
modified. That flag is turned on any key is released over the window
and that can indicate changes which may not actually change the text,
i. e., a false positive.</p>

<div class="section" id="inspecting-the-generated-python-modules">
<h3>Inspecting the Generated Python Modules<a class="headerlink" href="#inspecting-the-generated-python-modules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Often the user will want to look at the code that exists for a
project. To do that, execute page with the project name or open the
project and the select Gen_Python-&gt;Load Python Consoles. This will
open two Python Consoles; one with the GUI module and the other with
the support module. The loading of the consoles is from appropriate
modules saved to disk. If a Python Console exists with either the GUI
or support module, it will not be overwritten. If one or the other has
not been saved, then nothing is done with the corresponding Python Console.</p>
<p>My guess that this is most interesting when the user has modified the
GUI and generated a new GUI module and wants to see what any existing
support module looks like.  Again, in this situation, the new GUI code
is not automatically saved.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="executing-the-python-modules">
<h3>Executing the Python Modules<a class="headerlink" href="#executing-the-python-modules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To see what the GUI looks like, the user can run or execute the GUI
module. That can occur in two contexts, one is to execute the code
from one of the Python Consoles and the other is to load the modules
into an IDE and carry on development from there.  For execution within
PAGE there has to be a Python Console; the user can generate either
the GUI or the support module or load the project into the consoles
from the Gen_Python submenu.</p>
<p>To execute the GUI, select the Run button in a Python Console or using
the shortcut Control-R when the cursor is over a Python Console.</p>
<p>Let me discuss the skeletal functions first. Function references may
be referenced in several ways. If the function name is given the
skeletal function will be created in the support module. An example
would be to specify the command attribute in PAGE as &#8220;george&#8221;. In that
case, the skeletal support function &#8220;george&#8221; would be created in the
support module.
.. If the specification were given as &#8220;self.george&#8221;, the
.. skeletal module would created as a class function within the GUI
.. class.
If another module were specified as in &#8220;app.george&#8221;
PAGE would not create a skeleton function at all; your on your own to
create and import the &#8220;app&#8221; module. From this you can see the need to
create the support module before trying to execute the GUI module.</p>
<p>Similarly, Tkinter variable classes are defined or the GUI class or in
the support module depending on the presence or absence of &#8220;self.&#8221; at
the beginning of the specification.  If specified in the support
module, code is included to insure that the class is created before
the GUI execution references the class.</p>
<p>Because the use of &#8220;self.&#8221; in specifying functions and Tkinter variables
will require use code to be added to the GUI module, I avoid them in
my usage of PAGE.  Such specifications work against the benefits of
the rework facilities.</p>
<p>I frequently execute the GUI module to see how the Python version of GUI
looks. To that end, the support module is generated with very minimal
skeletal functions in order to check the appearance of the  GUI by
running from the Python console. The final lines of both the GUI
module are:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">&#39;__main__&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">vp_start_gui</span><span class="p">()</span>

</div>
<p>and the final lines of the support module are:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">&#39;__main__&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>which will call vp_start_gui when the either module is executed. The key
is vp_start_gui which is generated automatically. It contains some
code like the following, where &#8220;unknown&#8221; is the default project name within PAGE:</p>

code for the supporting module named &#8220;&lt;name&gt;_support.py&#8221;.  This file
will contain skeleton functions and Tkinter variables needed.  This
file will contain the principal code for the application.

.. is generated automatically once per application.</p>
<p>When you select the toplevel widget and Generate Python GUI from the

code. You can push the run button and execution will be attempted.
This will automatically save the generated code into a &#8221;.py&#8221; file
where the root name matches that of the tcl file which is also
automatically saved.  When running from the Python Window, line output
from the GUI is directed to the lower window of the Python Console.</p>
<p>Execution of the Python GUI is initiated by either selecting the &#8220;Run&#8221;

<h3>Loading Python files into an IDE<a class="headerlink" href="#loading-python-files-into-an-ide" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>The IDE is set in the Basics page of the Preferences.  PAGE tries to

<span id="id4"></span><h2>Applications with Multiple Top-Level Windows<a class="headerlink" href="#applications-with-multiple-top-level-windows" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Often the user will want to build applications which have more than
one top level window.  Since PAGE is built for the specification of
only one such window how does the user proceed?  I think that the best
approach is to create separate modules for each top level window and
have the support module for the main GUI import them using import
statements. The windows can then be created using the create function
in the modules.  This approach was used for the Vrex example above.
Here, I used PAGE to build skeletons for two separate program modules,
the main vrex program and the vrex_help module, and coupled the two by
having vrex, the main module, import vrex_help and invoke the help
window when the &#8220;Help&#8221; button was selected with the statement:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">vrex_help</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">help</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">vrex_help</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create_Vrex_Help</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">root</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Of course, there is very little interaction between the two programs
which simplifies things in this case. As in the example below, the
argument &#8220;root&#8221; ties the help window to the main window.</p>
<p>The same technique was used in the progress_bar example which shows
more interaction between the windows including the control of the
progress bar window from inside the main routine. Here the two
modules are main.py and progress_bar.py.
In main.py we have</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">progress_bar</span>

<span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">bar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">progress_bar</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create_Progress_Bar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">root</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here pass to the create routine, the parameter root which ties the two
windows together and the create routine returns the Progress_Bar
object which allows the main GUI to access all of the functions and
attributes of the Progress_Bar object, in turn allowing the main GUI
to advance the bar and to close the progress bar.</p>
<p>Special functions are created in the python code to facilitate the
creation and destruction of the window.</p>

<p>One can pass a variable number of parameters to the init function
of the support module using standard Python techniques built around
the &#8220;<a href="#id5"><span class="problematic" id="id6">*</span></a>args, <a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">**</span></a>kwargs&#8221; usage.</p>
<p>Obviously, if one wants to pass parameters to the init function of
the window, then one must modify the parameter list to the create
function above and to the call to ini in the above:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">create_Progress_Bar</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">root</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">other_args</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span>

     <span class="n">w_win</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Progress_Bar</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">w</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">other_args</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Also, one may pass a parameter to the &#8220;init&#8221; function in the support
module. This parameter may be any Python data type - ,integer, float,
etc., as well as lists, tuple, and dictionary.  So it is really a
variable length parameter list.  For instance, you might have code
like the following which I used in the <a class="reference internal" href="examples.html#double"><em>Clone</em></a> example :</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">p_dict_1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">&#39;geom&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;+200+650&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;instance&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;color&#39;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;firebrick&#39;</span><span class="p">}</span>

<p>A common question is how to share global variables across module. A

<h2>Busy Cursors<a class="headerlink" href="#busy-cursors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section describes how to change the cursor when in long running
sections of an application.  Changing to a busy cursor gives some
feedback to the application user who otherwise may think that the
application is hung, not doing anything.</p>
<p>One includes the following code at the module level of the support module:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Code added to allow one to change default cursor to a busy cursor.</span>

<span class="c1"># End of busy cursor code.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and the following lines of code are inserted in &#8220;init&#8221; in the support module:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">global</span> <span class="n">busyWidgets</span>

<span class="n">busyWidgets</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">top</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The first line goes in near the top of the function and the assignment
to busyWidgets is inserted after the root object is created. In one of
my applications the function &#8220;init&#8221; looks like:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">top</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">gui</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">&#39;&#39;&#39; Function to create the thread for periodically updating the GUI.&#39;&#39;&#39;</span>
    <span class="k">global</span> <span class="n">t</span>
    <span class="k">global</span> <span class="n">w</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">top_level</span>
    <span class="k">global</span> <span class="n">busyWidgets</span>
    <span class="n">w</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">gui</span>
    <span class="n">top_level</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">top</span>
    <span class="n">t</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">threading</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Thread</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">target</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">fill_window</span><span class="p">,)</span>
    <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">start</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">busyWidgets</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">top</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">w</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Scrolledtext1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The final line above sets the global variable busyWidgets to be a
tuple of those widgets I wish to display the busy cursor.  This is
from the example <a class="reference internal" href="examples.html#wcpe"><em>WCPE</em></a> where I want the busy cursor to appear
in the top level window as well as the Scrolledtextbox.</p>
<p>When starting a section of code which is likely to be long running, a
busy section, insert the following at the start:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">busyStart</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When leaving a busy section make the following the last statement():</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">busyEnd</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Obviously, an application could have numerous busy sections and they
might coincide with particular functions or not.</p>
<p>This code can be generalized for usage of any of the Tkinter cursors.</p>
